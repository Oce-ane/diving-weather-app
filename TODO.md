# How to make it better

## Frontend Design & UX
- Work on overall design and UI improvements.
- Make the app a single-page app inspired by Dribbble (WhatTheHex).
- Add a footer for extra information or links.

## Functionality
- Implement the map feature to select dive sites interactively.
- Improve autocomplete search to provide better suggestions.
- Add more robust handling of edge cases in search queries.

## Testing
- Implement unit tests for API calls.
- Add integration tests with Capybara for search and results flow.
- Test random search queries to ensure the app can handle unexpected results.

## Performance & Optimization
- Optimise API requests to reduce latency.
- Implement caching for search results to avoid redundant queries.
